<p>Complete Rules to the Noble Game of </p>

<h1 id="toc_0">CHASER</h1>

<p>A Fine Pastime From the Expert Hands and Minds at Infanteam</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">THE BASICS:</h2>

<p>Chaser is a game of pool where the objective is score points by pocketing balls, or force opponents into difficult positions so they get a penalty. Any number of players can play at once.</p>

<p>At every shot, the white <strong>cue ball</strong> <em>must</em> hit the lowest numbered ball on the table (the <strong>Target</strong> to chase) before it touches any of the other remaining balls. </p>

<p>Regardless of whether it&#39;s a legal shot or not, non-Target balls that are pocketed are always returned to the table - while the Target always stays down when pocketed.</p>

<p>You <strong>score</strong> points by pocketing balls in a legal shot. The Target ball doesn&#39;t need to be pocketed as long as the cue ball touches it first. The score is <em>the sum</em> of the numbers on every ball that goes down a pocket, as long as you made a legal shot. </p>

<p>If anything illegal happened during the shot (see the details), it&#39;s a <strong>Foul</strong>, and you get a <strong>penalty</strong> instead of scoring (even if the shot was otherwise legal). The penalty drawn from the player is equal to the number on <em>the single highest numbered ball</em> that was involved in the shot: hit out of sequence, pocketed, touched, or shot off the table. The penalty is always at least 4.</p>

<p>A common way to cause the player after you to get a penalty, is a <strong>Snook</strong>: placing the cue ball and the Target in such a position that there&#39;s no direct way to hit the Target legally - for example on opposite sides of other balls.</p>

<p>A player keeps shooting until they fail to pocket a ball, or make a Foul. After a Foul, the next player can choose to make the shot as normally, or <strong>pass it back</strong>: have the fouling player shoot again – possibly for another penalty. </p>

<p>The game is over when ball 15 is the Target, and is pocketed. <strong>The winner</strong> is the player with the most points.</p>

<h4 id="toc_3">Who can play and where?</h4>

<p>Chaser is played on a standard pool table with 6 pockets, between 2 or more players, with all 15 colored and numbered balls and one white cue ball. Any number of player can play in one game. The sequence between the players is optional: the same in every round, random, or by score in ascending or descending order. </p>

<h4 id="toc_4">For how long? Who wins?</h4>

<p>The game goes on until all 15 balls are shot down, in sequence. The winner is the player with the most points.</p>

<h4 id="toc_5">How do you score points?</h4>

<p>By making a legal shot where at least one (colored, not white) ball is shot down. The Target doesn&#39;t need to be pocketed as long as it&#39;s hit first by the cue ball. If you shoot down more than one ball, you score the sum of the numbers on them.</p>

<h4 id="toc_6">What is a legal shot?</h4>

<p>The lowest numbered ball on the table at any time is called the Target. In a legal shot, you shoot the white cue ball and hit the Target first – before touching any other ball and without anything else noted under <a href="https://github.com/espen42/chaser/blob/master/README.md#whatisanillegalshot">Illegal shots</a> happening. In other words, a legal shot is a shot where the white ball does hit the Target, hits it without hitting other balls first, and is not shot down in a pocket or off the table.</p>

<h4 id="toc_7">What happens after you’ve made a legal shot?</h4>

<ul>
<li>If no balls were shot down: no score, and it’s the next player’s turn.</li>
<li>If any balls were (legally) shot down, including the Target: 

<ul>
<li>First, note your score: the sum of numbers on the balls that were pocketed</li>
<li>Then, if any balls were shot down other than the Target, return them to the table as described under <a href="https://github.com/espen42/chaser/blob/master/README.md#returningcoloredballstothetable">Returning colored balls</a>. If the Target was shot down, it stays down. The next lowest-numbered ball on the table becomes the new Target.</li>
<li>Then, you can shoot again.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="toc_8">What is an illegal shot?</h4>

<p>An illegal shot / <em>Foul</em> is when ”something goes wrong”: if any of these events occur (and importantly: any one of them will turn an otherwise legal shot into a Foul):
- The cue ball misses the Target, 
- The cue ball touches another ball before hitting the Target,
- The cue ball is shot down into a pocket.
- Any ball jumps off the table,
- Or anything that would otherwise not be legal in a game of regular eight-ball pool (such as touching the cue ball a second time or in motion, with any body part, object or clothing, shooting with any other ball but the white one etc).</p>

<h4 id="toc_9">What happens after a Foul?</h4>

<ul>
<li>The player who made the shot is punished with a Penalty: a negative score / subtracting points from the player’s score. Yes, you can have a total score below 0.</li>
<li>If the Target was pocketed, it stays down, and the next ball becomes the Target. Return any other balls that were shot down to the table.</li>
<li>It’s the next player’s turn (if he/she accepts it. After a Foul, he/she may pass the turn back to you if the position is bad. More on this in <a href="https://github.com/espen42/chaser/blob/master/README.md#passingbackaturnafterafoul">Passing back a turn</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="toc_10">How bad is the Penalty?</h4>

<p>The Penalty is always at least 4 points. But it may be even worse if a numbered ball with a higher number than 4 is involved in the shot, by:
- missing the Target: the number on the Target
- touching another ball before the Target: the number on that other ball
- any ball was shot off the table: the number on that ball
- any ball was (otherwise legally) shot down in a Foul: the number on that ball
If several of these events happen at once, they <em>do not add up</em>; you’re only given one Penalty. Choose the Penalty for the single highest numbered ball involved in the Foul.</p>

<p>The only exception to this is the opening shot, where the shooting player may choose to risk it - see <a href="https://github.com/espen42/chaser/blob/master/README.md#scoringthefirstshot">Scoring the first shot</a>. </p>

<h4 id="toc_11">Passing back a turn after a Foul</h4>

<p>Usually, after a Foul you lose your turn to the next player, player X. However, after you’ve made a Foul (and only then) player X is free to choose to give the turn back to you – usually to force you to make another difficult shot and possibly getting another penalty. Player X can do this for as long as you keep making Fouls. If you score legally on a shot you’ve been passed back from player X, you get the score and get a new shot as in a regular turn.</p>

<p>After you’ve made a legal shot without scoring, it’s player X’s turn - and now, they must accept it. </p>

<h4 id="toc_12">Snooking</h4>

<p>A <em>Snook</em> is when the white ball after a legal shot ends up in a position where there is no possible legal and direct path to the Target. Nothing in particular happens here, but the player making the shot will have a more difficult shot to avoid a penalty.</p>

<p>Doing this on purpose with a legal shot (Snooking the next player) is a common strategy early in the game, because of the many colored balls to obstruct the path between the white ball and the Target. A Foul where the cue ball ends up in a Snook is the most common reason for the next player to pass the turn back to the previous player (Snooking yourself).</p>

<h4 id="toc_13">Returning colored balls to the table</h4>

<p>Colored balls (except the Target) are returned to the table whenever they are shot down. The Target stays down, and the next ball in sequence becomes the new Target to chase. All colored balls, including the Target, are of course returned if they are shot off the table.</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> they should be placed as close as possible (without moving other balls on the table) to the Foot Spot (the point that was the front corner in the beginning triangle). If more than one ball was shot down, or if the space is occupied by other balls on the table, the next balls are placed from there in a straight line backwards toward the back edge of the table. If more than one ball is returned, start with the lowest numbered, and go backwards toward the edge of the table, by ball number in sequence. </p>

<p>Note that this can sometimes produce a Snook, if a ball is returned to a position between the white ball and the next Target. As usual, if the previous shot was a legal and scoring shot, the player must shoot again - he/she may not pass the turn to the next player. If the previous shot was a Foul, the next player may pass it back at will.</p>

<h4 id="toc_14">Returning the white cue ball to the table, and doing the next shot</h4>

<p>The cue ball is returned whenever shot down or off the table. It should be placed wherever the shooting player chooses inside the rectangular starting area on the table (the Kitchen area). It can be shot in any direction, but <em>may not hit any colored ball before leaving the starting area</em>. </p>

<p><em>This means that if the Target ball is inside the starting area, it’s a Snook!</em></p>

<h4 id="toc_15">Setting up the game</h4>

<p>The balls are set up in a triangle like in regular eigth-ball pool – but with these variations:
- The balls 1, 2 and 3 are the outer corners of the triangle, and 1 is at the front corner (the Foot Spot).
- The balls 13, 14 and 15 are in the middle, and 15 is right behind 1 (where 8 is placed in eight-ball pool).</p>

<h4 id="toc_16">Scoring the first shot</h4>

<p>The first shot is scored in a special way. Before shooting, the player who makes the first shot chooses one of two ways of scoring:
- <strong>Safe:</strong> if more than one ball is legally shot down, he/she gets points for <em>only the most valuable ball</em>. In case of a Foul, the Penalty will be as usual (only the worst one of the numbers involved).
- <strong>Ballsy:</strong> if more than one ball is legally shot down, he/she gets the sum total of balls shot down (as usual). But if the shot is a Foul, <em>the Penalty is summed up</em>: the sum total of the penalties for every illegal event in that shot!</p>

<p>If they player doesn&#39;t say his choice out loud to the other players, it&#39;s Safe by default.</p>

<p>After the first shot, scoring is as usual, as described earlier. </p>

<h4 id="toc_17">Sequence of the players’ turns</h4>

<p>It’s recommended, but not necessary, to jumble or vary the sequence of players from one game to the next, since the ability to Snook the next player can have a big impact on the next player’s score. One suggestion is to play in the sequence of scoring from the previous game – lowest to highest.</p>
