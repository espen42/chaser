# CHASER
A	Fine	Pastime	From	the	Expert	Hands	and	Minds	at	Infanteam


## THE	BASICS:
Chaser	is	a game	of	pool	where	the	objective	is	score points by pocketing balls, or force opponents into difficult positions so they get a penalty. Any	number	of	players	can	play	at	once.

At	every	shot,	the	white	**cue	ball** _must_	hit	the	lowest	numbered	ball	on	the	table (the	**Target** to	chase) before it touches any	of	the	other	remaining	balls. 

Regardless of whether it's a legal shot or not, non-Target balls that are pocketed	are	always	returned	to	the	table - while the Target always stays down when pocketed.

You **score** points	by pocketing balls in a legal shot. The Target ball doesn't need to be pocketed as long as the cue ball touches it first. The score is _the sum_ of the	numbers	on every	ball	that	goes	down a	pocket,	as	long	as	you	made	a	legal	shot.	

If anything illegal happened during the shot (see the details), it's a **Foul**, and you get a **penalty** instead of scoring (even if the shot was otherwise legal). The	penalty	drawn from the player is	equal	to	the number on _the	single highest	numbered	ball_	that was involved in the shot: hit	out of	sequence, pocketed, touched, or shot off the table. The penalty is always at least 4.

A common way to cause the player after you to get a penalty, is a **Snook**: placing the cue ball and the Target in such a position that there's no direct way to hit the Target legally - for example on opposite sides of other balls.

A	player keeps	shooting	until	they	fail	to	pocket	a	ball,	or	make	a	Foul.	After	a	Foul, the	next	player	can	choose	to	make	the	shot as	normally, or **pass it back**: have	the	fouling	player	shoot	again	– possibly	for	another	penalty. 

The game is over when ball 15 is the Target, and is pocketed. **The winner** is the player with the most points.

#### Who	can	play	and	where?
Chaser	is	played	on	a	standard	pool	table with	6	pockets,	between 2	or	more	players,	with all 15	colored and	numbered	balls	and	one	white cue ball. Any number of player can play in one game. The sequence between the players is optional: the same in every round, random, or by score in ascending or descending order. 

#### For	how	long?	Who	wins?
The	game	goes	on	until all	15	balls	are	shot	down,	in sequence.	The	winner	is	the	player	with	the	most	points.

#### How	do	you	score	points?
By	making	a	legal	shot	where	at	least	one	(colored,	not	white)	ball	is	shot	down.	The Target doesn't need to be pocketed as long as it's hit first by the cue ball. If	you	shoot	down	more	than	one ball,	you	score	the	sum	of	the	numbers	on	them.
																																																							 
#### What	is	a	legal	shot?
The	lowest	numbered	ball	on	the	table at	any	time is	called	the	Target.	In	a	legal	shot,	you	shoot	the	white	cue	ball	and	hit	the	Target	first – before	touching	any	other	ball and	without	anything	else	noted	under	[Illegal	shots](https://github.com/espen42/chaser/blob/master/README.md#whatisanillegalshot) happening. In	other	words,	a	legal	shot	is	a	shot	where	the	white	ball	does	hit	the	Target,	hits	it	without	hitting	other	balls	first,	and	is	not	shot	down	in	a	pocket	or	off	the	table.

#### What	happens	after	you’ve	made	a	legal	shot?
  - If	no	balls	were	shot	down:	no	score,	and	it’s	the	next	player’s	turn.
  - If	any	balls	were	(legally)	shot	down,	including	the	Target:	
    - First,	note	your	score:	the	sum	of	numbers	on	the	balls that	were	pocketed
    - Then,	if	any	balls	were	shot	down	other	than	the	Target,	return	them	to	the	table	as	described under	[Returning	colored	balls](https://github.com/espen42/chaser/blob/master/README.md#returningcoloredballstothetable).	If the	Target was	shot	down, it	stays	down.	The	next	lowest-numbered	ball	on	the	table becomes	the new	Target.
    - Then,	you	can	shoot	again.
    
#### What	is	an	illegal	shot?
An	illegal	shot /	_Foul_	is	when	”something	goes	wrong”:	if	any	of	these	events	occur (and importantly:	any	one of	them	will	turn	an	otherwise legal	shot	into	a	Foul):
- The	cue	ball	misses	the	Target,	
- The	cue	ball	touches	another	ball	before	hitting	the	Target,
- The	cue	ball	is	shot	down into a pocket.
- Any	ball	jumps	off	the	table,
- Or anything	that	would	otherwise	not	be	legal	in	a	game	of	regular	eight-ball	pool	(such	as	touching	the	cue ball	a	second	time	or in	motion,	with	any	body	part,	object	or	clothing,	shooting	with	any	other	ball	but	the	white	one	etc).

#### What	happens	after	a	Foul?
- The	player	who	made	the	shot	is	punished	with	a	Penalty:	a	negative	score	/	subtracting	points from	the	player’s	score.	Yes,	you	can	have	a	total score	below	0.
- If	the	Target	was	pocketed,	it	stays	down,	and	the	next	ball	becomes	the	Target.	Return	any	other	balls	that	were	shot down to	the	table.
- It’s	the	next	player’s	turn	(if	he/she	accepts	it.	After	a	Foul,	he/she	may pass	the	turn	back	to	you	if	the	position	is	bad. More	on	this in	[Passing	back	a	turn](https://github.com/espen42/chaser/blob/master/README.md#passingbackaturnafterafoul)).

#### How	bad	is	the	Penalty?
The	Penalty	is	always	at	least	4	points. But	it	may	be	even worse	if	a	numbered	ball	with	a	higher	number	than	4	is	involved in the shot, by:
- missing	the	Target:	the	number	on	the	Target
- touching	another	ball	before	the	Target:	the	number	on	that	other	ball
- any	ball	was	shot	off	the	table:	the	number	on	that	ball
- any	ball	was	(otherwise	legally)	shot	down	in	a	Foul:	the	number	on	that	ball
If	several	of	these	events	happen	at	once,	they	_do	not	add	up_;	you’re	only	given	one	Penalty.	Choose	the	Penalty	for	the	single highest	numbered	ball	involved	in	the	Foul.

The	only	exception	to	this	is	the	opening	shot,	where	the	shooting	player	may	choose	to	risk	it - see [Scoring the first shot](https://github.com/espen42/chaser/blob/master/README.md#scoringthefirstshot). 

#### Passing	back	a	turn	after	a	Foul
Usually,	after	a	Foul	you	lose	your	turn	to	the	next	player,	player	X.	However,	after	you’ve	made	a	Foul (and	only	then)	player X is	free	to	choose	to	give	the	turn back to	you – usually	to force	you	to	make	another	difficult	shot	and	possibly	getting	another	penalty. Player	X	can	do	this	for	as	long	as	you	keep	making	Fouls.	If you	score	legally	on	a	shot	you’ve	been	passed	back	from	player	X,	you	get	the	score	and	get a	new	shot	as	in	a regular	turn.

After	you’ve	made	a	legal	shot without scoring,	it’s	player	X’s	turn -	and	now,	they	must	accept	it.	

#### Snooking
A	_Snook_	is	when	the	white	ball after	a	legal	shot	ends	up in	a	position	where	there	is	no	possible	legal and direct	path	to the	Target.	Nothing	in	particular	happens	here,	but the	player	making	the	shot	will have a more difficult shot to avoid	a	penalty.

Doing	this	on	purpose	with	a	legal	shot	(Snooking	the	next	player) is	a	common	strategy	early in the	game,	because of the	many	colored	balls	to	obstruct	the	path	between	the	white	ball	and	the	Target.	A	Foul	where	the	cue ball ends	up	in	a	Snook	is	the	most	common	reason	for	the	next	player	to	pass	the	turn	back	to	the	previous	player (Snooking	yourself).

#### Returning	colored	balls	to	the	table
Colored	balls	(except	the	Target) are	returned	to	the	table	whenever	they	are	shot	down.	The	Target	stays	down,	and	the	next	ball in sequence	becomes	the	new	Target to	chase.	All	colored	balls, including the	Target, are of	course	returned	if	they	are	shot	off	the	table.

**Position:**	they	should	be	placed as	close	as	possible	(without	moving	other	balls	on	the	table)	to	the	Foot	Spot	(the	point	that	was	the	front	corner	in	the	beginning	triangle). If	more	than	one	ball	was	shot	down,	or	if	the	space	is	occupied	by	other	balls	on	the	table,	the	next	balls	are	placed from	there in	a	straight	line	backwards	toward	the	back	edge	of	the	table. If	more	than	one	ball	is	returned,	start	with	the	lowest	numbered,	and	go backwards toward the edge of the table, by ball number	in	sequence.		

Note	that	this	can	sometimes	produce	a	Snook,	if	a	ball	is	returned	to	a	position	between	the	white	ball	and	the	next	Target.	As	usual,	if	the	previous	shot	was	a	legal	and	scoring	shot,	the	player	must	shoot	again	- he/she	may	not pass	the	turn	to	the	next	player.	If	the	previous	shot	was	a	Foul,	the	next	player	may	pass	it	back	at	will.

#### Returning	the	white cue ball	to	the	table,	and	doing	the	next	shot
The	cue	ball	is	returned	whenever	shot	down	or	off	the	table.	It	should	be	placed wherever	the	shooting	player	chooses	inside	the	rectangular starting	area	on	the	table (the	Kitchen	area).	It	can	be	shot	in	any	direction,	but	_may	not	hit	any	colored	ball	before	leaving	the	starting area_.	

_This	means	that	if	the	Target	ball	is	inside	the	starting	area,	it’s	a	Snook!_

#### Setting	up	the	game
The	balls	are	set	up in	a	triangle	like	in	regular	eigth-ball pool	– but with	these	variations:
- The	balls	1, 2	and	3	are	the	outer	corners	of	the	triangle,	and	1	is at	the	front corner (the	Foot	Spot).
- The	balls	13,	14	and	15	are	in	the	middle,	and	15	is	right	behind	1	(where	8	is	placed	in	eight-ball pool).

#### Scoring	the	first	shot
The first shot is scored in a special way. Before	shooting,	the	player	who	makes	the	first	shot	chooses one	of	two	ways	of	scoring:
- **Safe:**	if	more	than	one	ball	is	legally	shot	down,	he/she	gets	points	for	_only	the	most	valuable	ball_.	In	case	of	a	Foul,	the	Penalty	will	be as	usual	(only the	worst one	of	the numbers involved).
- **Ballsy:**	if	more	than	one	ball	is	legally	shot	down,	he/she	gets	the	sum	total	of	balls	shot	down	(as	usual).	But	if	the	shot	is	a	Foul,	_the	Penalty	is	summed	up_:	the	sum	total	of	the	penalties	for	every	illegal	event in	that	shot!

If they player doesn't say his choice out loud to the other players, it's Safe by default.

After	the	first	shot,	scoring	is	as	usual,	as	described	earlier.	

#### Sequence	of	the	players’ turns
It’s	recommended, but	not	necessary, to	jumble	or	vary	the	sequence	of	players	from	one	game	to	the	next,	since	the	ability	to	Snook	the	next	player	can	have	a	big	impact	on	the	next	player’s	score.	One	suggestion	is	to	play	in	the	sequence	of	scoring	from	the	previous game	– lowest	to	highest.
